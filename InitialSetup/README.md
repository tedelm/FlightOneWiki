# Initial build and setup

## Steps for success
1. Choose a good and stiff frame
2. Check your motors, a bent motorshaft will kill your drone (no kidding)
3. Your flightcontroller stack should contain of FC and ESC, nothing more (stop glueing stuff ontop)
4. Use four (4) long screws for the full stack height, you dont need nuts ontop (if you must, then see to it that they just touch the rubber grommits, not pressing)
5. Add a 1000uf 35v or bigger capacitor (CAP), like 2000uf 35v, or even bigger.

## Maiden flight
- [ ] DO NOT CHANGE ANY FILTERS OR PIDs (Everything should be able to fly on defaults)
- [ ] Do a dry run: Try it on the floor without any props, yaw right/left, check if it rotates in right direction
- [ ] Do a hover test, check for strange noise and hot motors
- [ ] Take it for a maiden flight, if it vibrates you will probably need to go thru your build and check wires etc not touching the flightcontroller
